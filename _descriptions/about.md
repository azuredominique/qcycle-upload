# Upload additional data for QCycle
Besides collecting data directly from your Oura Ring through your Open Humans account,
we are asking you to provide some additional data over the course of our project:

- A spreadsheet of your axial body temperature (collected with the XYZ sensor)
- A spreadsheet of your distal body temperature (collected with the XYZ sensor)
- A spreadsheet of your dates of menses and symptoms (exported from Life or Cycle Track App)
